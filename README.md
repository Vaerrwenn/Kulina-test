# Kulina-Test
This is my Kulina's Backend Developer Preliminary Test submission.

## Requirement
* Golang 1.15.7

## Installation
* Download or fork this project.

## Usage
There are 4 questions in this test. Each of them are in the `cmd` folder and named `quizx` where x is the number of the question. To run them, use `go run cmd/quizx/main.go`.   
So, for example, if you want to run the solution for question 1, run `go run cmd/quiz1/main.go`.   

## Testing
To run tests, use `go test cmd/quizx/main.go cmd/quizx/main_test.go`, where x is the number of the question.   
For example, if you want to run the test solution for question 2, run `go go test cmd/quiz2/main.go cmd/quiz2/main_test.go`.   
There are only 2 solutions that have test file.
